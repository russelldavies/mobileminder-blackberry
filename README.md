mobileminder-blackberry
=======================

Legacy BlackBerry client for MobileMinder.

Note that this application no longer works with MobileMinder as the protocol has significantly changed (for the better). The target device platform is BlackBerry Java devices, version 5+.

Most of this code is too esoteric for any generic reuse. But if you find yourself with the unpleasant task of having to scoop up information on a BlackBerry, this might be useful.
